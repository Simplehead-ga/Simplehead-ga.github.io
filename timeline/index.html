                        <h1>First Site</h1>
                        <p>So After The "Lockdown" happend i searched for things to do so i came across this video in which the youtuber tells about this website through which you can make websites so i opened the site on my old 2016 tablet and made a simple website about my youtube channel it was somthing like mcgamer so this was my first site.</p>

                        <h1>First App</h1>
                        <p>So after making my first site i set a goal for myself it was that if my site gets 200 unique visitors i will make a app for the site and my site did reach the goal so i search on youtube again and came across this app called "Sketchware" and watched tutorials on how to convert a website into app and made my first app after that i kept getting better in "Sketchware".</p>
